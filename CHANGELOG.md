# CHANGELOG.md
## [0.1.14] 2025-??
 - Fixed bug when cells are centred vertically.
 - Added "level" keyword for highlight dictionary.
  - l0: show highlight above base rows
  - l1: show highlight above selected cells/rows
  - l2: show highlight above cursor cell/row.
 - Added separate selected_column argument (distinct from sort_column) so that columns can be navigated without sorting on the selected column. 's' has to be pressed on the selected_column to trigger sorting.
 - Changed scrolling to start/end so that it selects the first/last column.
 - Bug fixes:
   - When data was centred vertically it would take an extra draw_screen loop to determine the proper column widths when the column sizes changed. This has been fixed.
   - Refreshing sorted data would resort it on the selected column rather than the sort column. Fixed.
 - Added some extra options to the settings:
   - Toggle header
   - Toggle row header
   - Toggle modes
   - Add/insert blank row
   - Add/insert blank column
 - Added splash screen to picker which can be displayed when loading a large data set, for example.
 - Ensured that the curses colour pairs are redefined if we are loading from a picker save state.
 - Added functions to insert an empty row/column at an an arbitrary position in the picker items.
 - Adjusted the commandline arguments so that the filename can be passed without the -i flag.
 - If no input file type is specified on the command line it will now guess based on the input file's extension.
 - Improved display of cells/rows with various unicode characters. It is much better but there are still some problems with alignment and highlighting.
